## What it does
We examine Alberta's wildfires from 2006-2021 under a data science perspective. We provide useful insights on wildfire trends and an XGBoost prediction model. 

## How we built it
We began by preprocessing the dataset extensively; this included normalizing values, imputing data, and feature engineering. We then visualized the data to uncover patterns and gain intuition about the problem. After, we developed an XGBoost model to predict wildfire size classes with ~90+% accuracy. Finally, we summarized our findings and methodologies in a paper. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges along the way, from preprocessing missing values and removing outliers, identifying important features, and tuning the model, among many others! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was the first data science experience for the entire team; we learned Pandas and Matplot, various machine learning models like Random Forests and LightGBM, to best practices like hyperparmeter-tuning and encoding strategies!

## What's next for Alberta Wildfire Prediction
There is lots of work to be done in this area. We are all excited about future research projects in the space.
